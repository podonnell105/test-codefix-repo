# Progress Log - JavaScript Event List App

## Current Thinking
Created a complete JavaScript event list application using Node.js built-in modules (no external packages needed). The app provides a modern, responsive interface for managing events with full CRUD functionality.

## Created Files and Changes

### 1. `server.js` - HTTP Server
- **What it does**: Creates a lightweight HTTP server using Node.js built-in `http`, `fs`, and `path` modules
- **Key features**:
  - Serves static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
  - Provides REST API endpoints for events (`/api/events`)
  - Handles GET (list events), POST (add event), and DELETE (remove event) operations
  - Includes CORS headers for cross-origin requests
  - In-memory storage for events (includes 4 sample events)
  - Runs on port 3000 by default

### 2. `index.html` - Frontend Interface
- **What it does**: Provides the main user interface for the event list application
- **Key features**:
  - Clean, modern HTML structure with semantic markup
  - Event creation form with title, date, time, and description fields
  - Event list display area that dynamically updates
  - Responsive design with mobile-friendly layout
  - Uses emoji icons for visual appeal

### 3. `style.css` - Modern Styling
- **What it does**: Provides beautiful, responsive styling for the application
- **Key features**:
  - Gradient backgrounds and modern card-based design
  - Hover effects and smooth transitions
  - Mobile-responsive layout with media queries
  - Clean typography and spacing
  - Color-coded elements (form, events, buttons)
  - Professional appearance with shadows and rounded corners

### 4. `script.js` - Frontend Logic
- **What it does**: Handles all client-side functionality and API communication
- **Key features**:
  - EventApp class for organized code structure
  - Async/await for API calls to the server
  - Event loading, adding, and deleting functionality
  - Real-time UI updates without page refresh
  - Input validation and error handling
  - Success/error notifications with animations
  - HTML escaping for security
  - Date and time formatting for better readability

## Reasoning Behind Design Choices

1. **No External Packages**: Used Node.js built-in modules instead of Express to meet the "don't install packages" requirement
2. **In-Memory Storage**: Simple data storage solution that doesn't require a database setup
3. **Modern UI**: Clean, gradient-based design for better user experience
4. **REST API**: Standard API endpoints for scalability and maintainability
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive CSS
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly notifications
7. **Security**: HTML escaping to prevent XSS attacks

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory in terminal
2. Run `node server.js`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser
4. Start adding and managing events!

## Current Status
✅ Complete working application with all requested features
✅ No external package dependencies
✅ Modern, responsive design
✅ Full CRUD functionality for events
✅ Error handling and user feedback
